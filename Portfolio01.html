				<p>Hi! My name is Alex Shoucri and I am a developer who once was a chemical engineer. I am a curious individual who is passionate about science, math and technology. I was first introduced to programming during my studies, in the context of scientific computation. And, I couldn't go back after that!</p>
				<p>The one thing I loved about engineering was designing and developping processes. How can you brilliantly achieve this challenge? By applying these key properties: creativity, determination, innovation, passion and most importantly, honesty. </p>
				<p>After completing my B.Eng., I was invited to attend a workshop at PyCon 2014 in Montreal, QC, about the benefits of programming. It was then &amp there that I had an epiphany, realized the power &amp potential of developping software, and the millions of possibilities that existed in creating something new and useful for the public.</p>
				<p>In 2015, I finally completed my M.A.Sc. and entered the job market, only to realize very quickly that I could do so much more for our society through programming. So, <span>I went rogue</span>.</p>

				<p>At first, I started learning front-end development on the side while I was curator and organizer of the popular <a href="https://popmontreal.com/en/section/puces-pop/" target="_blank">Puces POP</a>, created by <a href="https://popmontreal.com/" target="_blank">POP Montreal</a>. Puces POP is an evergrowing indoor marketplace like no other: it promotes the Montreal artisan indie scene and attracts +10,000 visitors to every event.</p>
				<p> When I resigned in October 2016, I started front-end development full-time and full-blast! I am working to become a full-stack developper.</p>
				<p>My long-term goals include back-end development and data analysis. Until then, it would be my pleasure to create something awesome for you in your image, as your front-end developer.</p>
				<p>I live on coffee and music. They are the two things that fuel my work. <a href="#work">Have a look</a>, I've prepared some examples.</p>
